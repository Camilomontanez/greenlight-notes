{"title":"local vrs global ","message":"any variable declared with the keyword var inside a function will be considered a LOCAL DEFINED VARIABLE and it can only be visible within the function.\n\nvariables created without the key word var will be considered of global scope. THIS HAs TO BE AVOIDED. created variables should always have the key word VAR to avoid issues.\n\nIt is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.\n\nIn this example:\n\nvar someVar = \"Hat\";\nfunction myFun() {\n  var someVar = \"Head\";\n  return someVar;\n}\n\nThe function myFun will return \"Head\" because the local version of the variable is present.","id":"e6c3be70-8459-4299-aaea-87908d5e39a1","date":"2018-12-11T17:26:18.311Z","updated":"2018-12-11T17:32:04.945Z"}
